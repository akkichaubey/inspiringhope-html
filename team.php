                            <p>Hi! I'm MacKenzie. I am a graduate of Lindsey Wilson College with my M.Ed. in Counseling
                                and am currently a LPCA in Kentucky and a LPC in Ohio. I decided to pursue a career in
                                the mental health field for my genuine passion for helping others navigate through
                                challenging times and supporting them in improving their mental well-being. My passion
                                and treatment of focus include anxiety, depression, stress, wellness, as well as school,
                                women’s, and self-esteem issues.</p>
                            <p>My work experience includes working with children in inpatient and school-based settings,
                                with behavioral and mental health issues. General population I work with includes youth
                                ages 7-25. I practice a holistic and eclectic counseling approach as well as incorporate
                                DBT, CBT, Solution-Focused, Person-Centered, Play Therapy, Art Therapy and Reality
                                Therapy techniques.</p>
                            <p>Enrolling in therapy is a powerful step towards self-discovery, growth, and healing. It
                                takes courage to confront challenges and prioritize your mental health. I commend you
                                for taking the first step!</p>

                                couples and families where they are at, and use a combination of approaches in my work.
                                I have
                                experience with trauma informed care, CBT, and strength-based approaches. I understand
                                the importance of utilizing your strengths and interests throughout sessions to help
                                integrate therapy practice into your daily life. I work to help build growth and enjoy
                                being able to see you put what you have learned into practice and achieve their goals. I
                                have experience working with anxiety, depression, self-esteem, couples and
                                families. I believe in life that the grass is greener where you water it, and I am here
                                to help you water yours! I see clients age 10 to 55 years old.</p>

                            <p>My name is Joe and I am a KY Licensed Pastoral Counselor (M.Div.). I’ve been a counselor
                                for six years; prior to that I served as a youth and campus minister, an associate
                                pastor for
                                worship and recovery ministries in a new church, and as a senior pastor. In therapy,
                                faith can be part of our conversation, but not all my clients are religious. I believe
                                clients experience acceptance and absence of judgment when they see me. </p>
                            <p>Much of my work has been with couples, using the Gottman method. I am also a Certified
                                Grief Informed Professional. It is an honor to come alongside people who are mourning
                                the death of a loved one or some other significant loss. I see young adults through
                                older adults as they struggle with meaning, purpose, self-worth, anxiety, depression,
                                family and work struggles,
                                addiction, religious trauma, and more.</p>
                            <p>I believe there is peace for your troubled heart and hope for your journey!</p>

                            <p>As a mother of two boys with ADHD and autism, and having ADHD myself, I see the daily
                                battles they face in a world that isn’t built for neurodivergent minds. I know what it’s
                                like to worry that your children will face the same misunderstandings and
                                struggles. My heart aches for those who, like me and my boys, navigate a society that
                                doesn’t always see or value the beauty of a brain that thinks differently.</p>
                            <p>My experiences in both the criminal justice and medical fields showed me the urgent need
                                for compassionate mental health care. I felt called to provide the empathy and
                                understanding that so many people long for. My hope is that, through this
                                journey, I can help others realize they’re not broken; they’re just navigating a world
                                that hasn’t fully understood them yet.</p>
