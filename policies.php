                <h3>Cancellations:</h3>
                <p>Please notify us at least 48 hours in advance if you can’t make your appointment. If you miss your
                    appointment and/or fail to notify us, there is a $105 fee.</p>
                <p>APPOINTMENTS AND CANCELLATIONS Please remember to cancel or reschedule 48 hours in advance. You will
                    be responsible for the entire fee if cancellation is less than 48 hours (this doesn’t include
                    unforeseen circumstances, I.E- illness, severe weather, etc.)</p>
                <p>The standard meeting time for psychotherapy/life coaching is 50 minutes/ 45 minutes for EAP. It is up
                    to you, however, to determine the length of time of your sessions. Requests to change the 50-minute
                    session needs to be discussed with the therapist/life coach in order for time to be scheduled in
                    advance.</p>
                <p>A $50.00 service charge will be charged for any checks returned for any reason for special handling
                    and/or insufficient funds denial from check or charge cards(this includes HSA and FSA cards).</p>
                <p>Cancellations and re-scheduled session will be subject to a $ 105.00 charge for individual sessions/
                    $50 for group sessions ( $50 an hour) and/or current life coaching fee per session. (if you bought a
                    package, it will be considered one of your visits) if NOT RECEIVED AT LEAST 48 HOURS IN ADVANCE (
                    see consent to treat and new patient forms). This is necessary because a time commitment is made to
                    you and is held exclusively for you. If you are more than 10 late for a telehealth or 15 minutes
                    late for an in person session, you will need to reschedule.</p>
                <p><strong>TELEPHONE ACCESSIBILITY</strong></p>
                <p>If you need to contact a clinician/life coach between sessions, please leave a message with the front
                    desk or on the clinician’s/life coach’s voice mail. Clinicians/Life coaches often are not
                    immediately available; however, they will attempt to return your call within 24-72 business hours.
                    Please note that Face- to-face sessions and/or to video sessions are the only sessions covered by
                    insurance. ANYONE ABUSING THE PHONE BY CALLING MULTIPLE TIMES IN A ROW AND NOT LEAVING A MESSAGE
                    DURING BUSINESS HOURS WILL BE DISCHARGED.</p>
                <p>However, in the event that you are out of town, sick or need additional support, phone sessions are
                    available. If a true emergency situation arises, please call 911, text 988 or any local emergency
                    room.</p>
                <p><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA AND TELECOMMUNICATION</strong></p>
                <p>Due to the importance of your confidentiality and the importance of minimizing dual relationships,
                    our clinicians/life coaches do not accept friend or contact requests from current or former clients
                    on any social networking site (Facebook, LinkedIn, etc). We believe that adding clients as friends
                    or contacts on these sites can compromise your confidentiality and our respective privacy. It may
                    also blur the boundaries of our therapeutic relationship. If you have questions about this, please
                    bring them up when we meet and we can talk more about it.</p>
                <p><strong>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION</strong></p>
                <p>We cannot ensure the confidentiality of any form of communication through electronic media, including
                    text messages. If you prefer to communicate via email or text messaging for issues regarding
                    scheduling or cancellations, we will do so. While clinicians/life coaches may try to return messages
                    in a timely manner, we cannot guarantee immediate response and request that you do not use these
                    methods of communication to discuss therapeutic content and/or request assistance for emergencies.
                </p>
                <p>Services by electronic means, including but not limited to telephone communication, the Internet,
                    facsimile machines, and e-mail is considered telemedicine by the State of California. Under the
                    California Telemedicine Act of 1996, telemedicine is broadly defined as the use of information
                    technology to deliver medical services and information from one location to another. If you and your
                    therapist chose to use information technology for some or all of your treatment, you need to
                    understand that:</p>
                <p>(1) You retain the option to withhold or withdraw consent at any time without affecting the right to
                    future care or treatment or risking the loss or withdrawal of any program benefits to which you
                    would otherwise be entitled.<br>
                    (2) All existing confidentiality protections are equally applicable.<br>
                    (3) Your access to all medical information transmitted during a telemedicine consultation is
                    guaranteed, and copies of this information are available for a reasonable fee.<br>
                    (4) Dissemination of any of your identifiable images or information from the telemedicine
                    interaction to researchers or other entities shall not occur without your consent.<br>
                    (5) There are potential risks, consequences, and benefits of telemedicine. Potential benefits
                    include, but are not limited to improved communication capabilities, providing convenient access to
                    up-to-date information, consultations, support, reduced costs, improved quality, change in the
                    conditions of practice, improved access to therapy, better continuity of care, and reduction of lost
                    work time and travel costs.</p>
                <p>Effective counseling/life coaching is often facilitated when the counselor/life coach gathers within
                    a session or a series of sessions, a multitude of observations, information, and experiences about
                    the client.</p>
                <p>*Counselors may make clinical assessments, diagnosis, and interventions based not only on direct
                    verbal or auditory communications, written reports, and third person consultations, but also from
                    direct visual and olfactory observations, information, and experiences. When using information
                    technology in therapy services, potential risks include, but are not limited to the counselor’s
                    inability to make visual and olfactory observations of clinically or therapeutically potentially
                    relevant issues such as:</p>
                <p>your physical condition including deformities, apparent height and weight, body type, attractiveness
                    relative to social and cultural norms or standards, gait and motor coordination, posture, work
                    speed, any noteworthy mannerism or gestures, physical or medical conditions including bruises or
                    injuries, basic grooming and hygiene including appropriateness of dress, eye contact (including any
                    changes in the previously listed issues), sex, chronological and apparent age, ethnicity, facial and
                    body language, and congruence of language and facial or bodily expression.</p>
                <p>Potential consequences thus include the counselor/life coach not being aware of what he or she would
                    consider important information, that you may not recognize as significant to present verbally the
                    counselor.</p>
                <p><strong>***PLEASE NOTE:</strong> If you allow a contact to be emailed and/or texted on the contact
                    page they WILL ALSO GET APPOINTMENT REMINDERS.</p>
                <p>MINORS If you are a minor, your parents may be legally entitled to some information about your
                    therapy/life coaching. We will discuss with you and your parents what information is appropriate for
                    them to receive and which issues are more appropriately kept confidential.</p>
                <p><strong>TERMINATION</strong></p>
                <p>Ending relationships can be difficult. Therefore, it is important to have a termination process in
                    order to achieve some closure. The appropriate length of the termination depends on the length and
                    intensity of the treatment. We may terminate treatment after appropriate discussion with you and a
                    termination process if we determine that the psychotherapy/life coaching is not being effectively
                    used or if you are in default on payment. We will not terminate the therapeutic/life coaching
                    relationship without first discussing and exploring the reasons and purpose of terminating. If
                    counseling is terminated for any reason or you request another counselor/life coach, we will provide
                    you with a list of qualified psychotherapists/life coaches to treat you. You may also choose someone
                    on your own or from another referral source.</p>
                <p>Should you fail to schedule an appointment for three consecutive weeks, unless other arrangements
                    have been made in advance, for legal and ethical reasons, we must consider the professional
                    relationship discontinued.</p>
